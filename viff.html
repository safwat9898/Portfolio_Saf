    <h2>Enhancing in-person VIFF experience through an interactive microsite</h2>
    <p class="project-content">This project was completed for the Information Design course at <a class="text-link" href="https://www.sfu.ca/">Simon Fraser University</a>. Our team was tasked to propose a digital intervention for a local non-profit organization. The goal of this project was to pick a client, identify an existing problem that the client is currently facing, and come up with a design proposal to address this issue.</p>

    <h4 class="subtitle">Our Client</h4>
     <h2>Vancouver International Film Festival</h2>
     <img class="viff" src="assets/img/viff-theatre.jpeg" alt="VIFF Theatre">
     <p class="project-content">After conducting thorough primary and secondary research, <span class="bold">I proposed <a class="text-link" href="https://viff.org/" target="_blank">Vancouver International Film Festival</a> to be our client for this project</span>. Based on my findings, the internet has vastly changed the film exhibition industry over the past two decades, and fundamentally shifted the role of festivals. According to VIFF’s Strategic Plan (2021-2023), they are currently at risk of becoming outdated and uncompetitive due to lack of digital infrastructure.</p>
   </section>

   <section id="research">
     <h4 class="subtitle">Findings</h4>
     <h2>Research Process</h2>
     <p class="project-content"><span class="bold">Based on my secondary research, there has been a decline in interest in attending in-person events</span> like Vancouver International Film Festival, especially for younger generations. According to a 2020 report on the Sundance Film Festival, 27% of the audience was aged 26-35, 18.3% were between 18 and 25, and only 0.3% were under 18. To address this issue, our team decided to create a microsite that will target Gen Z, who are at the forefront of cultural trends and adept at navigating technology. By focusing on this demographic and emphasizing in-person engagement, VIFF can potentially expand its audience base.</p>
     <h2>Design Focus</h2>
     <p class="highlight-content">How can we enhance in-person festival experience for the younger community and bring them together in this digital era where organic connections are often lost?</p>

   <section id="passport">
    <h4 class="subtitle">Our Idea</h4>
    <h2>Digital Passport Program</h2>
    <img class="museum" src="assets/img/museum-passport.png" alt="Museum passport">
    <p class="caption">Children’s Passport at National Museum of Singapore</p>
    <p class="project-content">Our team came up with a Digital Passport idea. Taking inspiration from the <a class="text-link" href="https://www.nhb.gov.sg/nationalmuseum/" target="_blank">National Museum of Singapore</a> where visitors collect stamps as proof of in-person presence, we thought that Vancouver International Film Festival could benefit from a similar strategy. We wanted to modernize the process by introducing a digital passport and stamps collected through scanning a custom QR code during any in-person event at VIFF.</p>
    <h3 class="h3-title">Content Strategy</h3>
    <p class="project-content">As a starting point, <span class="bold">I suggested creating a dedicated landing page that users would visit before accessing the main Digital Passport page</span>. This approach would provide a better overview of the Digital Passport Program and prevent confusion for first-time users.</p>
    <img class="sitemap" src="assets/img/sitemap.png" alt="Sitemap">
    <p class="caption">Sitemap</p>
     <p class="project-content">After visiting the landing page, users can navigate to the Digital Passport page (My Passport 23’) to view featured VIFF events. Once they log in or register for the program, they can start collecting digital stamps by attending the in-person events listed on the site. Aside from the Digital Passport, we have decided to add a new functionality called VIFF Wrapped in order to enhance overall experience. Inspired by <a class="text-link" href="https://open.spotify.com/" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, VIFF Wrapped is a data analysis tool that compiles insightful statistics based on the films and events attended by users throughout the festival. This personalized analysis offers users a unique perspective on their cinematic preferences.</p>

    <h4 class="subtitle">First Iteration</h4>
    <h2>Mockups</h2>
    <p class="project-content">During the initial design process, I collaborated with my teammate, Jae Eun Kim, to create the first mockup iterations for the landing page.</p>

  <section id="feedback">
    <h4 class="subtitle">Post-Critique Feedback</h4>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p class="project-content">Our teaching team pointed out that the initial mockups lacked certain playfulness and nostalgic elements, especially if we want to engage younger generation. The landing page did not effectively convey information about the program since there was not enough details provided about the step-by-step process, prizes, and the passport itself.</p>
  </section>

   <section id="art">
    <h4 class="subtitle">Design</h4>
    <h2>New Art Direction</h2>
    <img class="moodboard" src="assets/img/moodboard.png" alt="Moodboard">
    <p class="caption">Moodboard</p>
    <p class="project-content">After discussing the feedback with the team, <span class="bold">I created a custom moodboard to assist us in making further design decisions</span>, especially if we wanted to align with the playful and childlike aesthetic for our microsite. During our design process, <span class="bold">I also selected the colour scheme and typeface</span> based on our research and the overall feel we wanted to achieve. <span class="bold">I chose <a class="text-link" href="https://www.typewolf.com/karla" target="_blank">Karla</a> as one of the main typefaces</span> as it brings a unique character through imperfections and stands out with its quirky charm.</p>
   </section>

   <section id="mockups">
    <h2>Final Mockups</h2>
    <h3 class="h3-title">Landing Page</h3>
    <p class="project-content">As a team, we collaborated on the final microsite design, revising the initial version to match the playful retro style. This was achieved by incorporating a vibrant yellow as the main background colour and adding visuals, including festival tickets, digital stamps, the passport itself and relevant imagery. <span class="bold">I was particularly responsible for the landing page redesign, VIFF Wrapped and some parts of the Digital Passport Program page designs</span>.<span class="bold"> I also proposed the idea of incorporating a storytelling element into the landing page</span>. Now, we present information in a structured manner, with sections explaining the participation process, merchandise prizes, and the program's backstory.</p>

    <h3 class="h3-title">Digital Passport Program Page (My Passport 23’)</h2>
    <p class="project-content">The Digital Passport Program page allows horizontal scrolling to view the timeline. Each circle represents a corresponding event at Vancouver International Film Festival 2023. On click, circles display a pop-up window (designed in an old browser style) with detailed information and a stamp (if collected) or a stamp placeholder (if not collected).</p>
    <img class="mockups" src="assets/img/timeline.png" alt="Passport program page">

    <h3 class="h3-title">VIFF Passport & VIFF Wrapped</h2>
    <p class="project-content">At the end of the timeline, users can navigate to the VIFF Digital Passport to view all stamps and VIFF Wrapped to see a custom data analysis based on attended events. Both pages are encouraged to be shared on social media in order to help generate more buzz online.</p>

   <section id="takeaways">
    <h4 class="subtitle">Takeaways</h4>
    <h2>What Did I Learn?</h2>
    <p class="project-content">This project provided valuable learning experience in several aspects. First and foremost, it taught me the importance of effective teamwork through collaborative efforts. The project's fast-paced nature, with weekly deliverables and presentations, challenged me to manage my time efficiently while engaging in frequent brainstorming sessions. This experience has greatly contributed to my growth as a designer, enhancing my skills in interaction design and emphasizing the significance of empathy in user-centered design. While satisfied with the project's outcome, I recognize the potential for improvement in my approach. For instance, I would implement a more structured schedule, allocating dedicated time slots for research and design phases. This strategic planning could help promote a more balanced progression throughout the project.</p>
